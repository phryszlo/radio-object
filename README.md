Objective: We are going to create an object Radio! 

 

Happy coding!

How to begin: 
Create a new HTML/CSS/JS and complete the following in your .js file
Make a radio Object.Give it a property called stations and make the value an array of station objects
Give each station object a property called name and songs. Name should be a string and should be an array of song objects.
Song object should have two properties: title and artist
Create a method on your radio object that changes the station randomly. 
When the station is changed, pick a song from that station console.log("Now Playing:" + song,title + "by" + song.artist)
